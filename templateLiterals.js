// Template literals, often referred to as template strings,
//  are a feature in JavaScript that allow for easy and more readable 
//  string interpolation. They use backticks (`) instead of 
//  single or double quotes, and placeholders ${} to embed expressions within strings. 



// This makes it simpler to create strings with dynamic content without the need for concatenation or 
// escaping characters. Template literals can span multiple lines, making multiline strings much cleaner to write and maintain.
